Hey everyone, welcome to my channel! In this video, we're going to take a look at a really cool Card interaction animation that I think you're going to love it.


As you can see on the screen, we have a card with an image and some text on it. The card has a black background and when we hover over it, the image fades and scales down a bit, while the text becomes more prominent.


Let's take a look at the CSS code that makes this happen. First, we set all margins and paddings to zero and use the box-sizing property to ensure that everything fits nicely inside the card. We also set the height of the body to 100% so that the card is centered vertically on the screen.

Next, we create a .card class that sets the position to relative and gives it a specific width and height. We also set the background color to black and use the overflow property to ensure that the image doesn't spill over the edges of the card.

Then we create a .card__image class that sets the height and width to 100% and uses the object-fit property to ensure that the image fits inside the card without distortion. We also add a scale and transition effect to make it appear as though the image is shrinking slightly when we hover over the card.

The .card__body class is set to position absolute and is inset 0 so that it covers the entire card. We give it some padding, color and alignment properties to make the text look nice. We also add a transition effect to make the text appear as though it's popping out of the card when we hover over it.

Finally, we add a ::before pseudo-element to the .card__body class and give it a border and a transition effect to create a nice highlight effect when we hover over the card.


And there you have it! That's how you create a cool CSS card with hover effects using just a few lines of code. I hope you enjoyed this video and found it helpful. Don't forget to like, comment and subscribe for more awesome coding videos like this one. Thanks for watching!
